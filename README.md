## ðŸ“– Theory

**Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** is one of the leading causes of illness and death globally.  
The **10-year CHD risk** score estimates the likelihood of developing CHD within the next decade, based on risk factors such as:

- Age, Gender  
- Blood Pressure & Hypertension medication use  
- Cholesterol & Glucose levels  
- Smoking status & cigarettes per day  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Medical history (Stroke, Diabetes, Hypertension)  

HeartWise uses a **Ridge Regression** model trained on medical datasets to classify users into:
- `0` â†’ Low 10-year CHD risk  
- `1` â†’ High 10-year CHD risk  

By identifying high-risk individuals early, lifestyle changes and medical interventions can be applied to reduce heart disease likelihood.
